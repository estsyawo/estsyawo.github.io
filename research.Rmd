  **Abstract**: Firms’ research and development (R&D) efforts are known to have spillover effects on other firms’ outcomes, e.g., innovation. Quantifying R&D spillover effects on innovation requires a spatial matrix that characterises the strength of connectivity between firms. Estimates can be biased if the spatial matrix is misspecified. This paper proposes a parsimonious approach to estimating parameters and the spatial matrix from panel data, when the spatial matrix is partly or fully unknown, in order to quantify R&D spillovers on innovation. The approach is applicable to single index models, and it allows asymmetry and time-variation in the spatial matrix. The paper establishes consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE under conditional independence and conditional strong-mixing assumptions on the outcome variable. On firm
innovation, we find positive spillover and private effects of R&D. We provide evidence of timevariation and asymmetry in the interaction structure between firms and find that geographic proximity and product market proximity are relevant. Moreover, the strength of connectivity between firms is not limited to often-assumed notions of closeness; it is also linked to past R&D and patenting behaviour of firms.

  **Abstract**: This paper introduces an estimator for a general class of models under rank deficiency arising from high dimensionality, multicollinearity, or both. Our approach obtains a projection matrix that projects a high-dimensional (potentially growing p >> n) parameter vector into a reduced consistently estimable one. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Recovering the high-dimensional parameter vector using the projection matrix leaves precision unaffected. We employ a sequential estimation algorithm that, at once, obtains parameter estimates and the projection matrix. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate a high approximative ability of high-dimensional parameters, improved precision, and reduced bias even under multicollinearity. In our empirical application, we find that firms on average generate positive R&D spillovers on firm productivity though these are dominated by private returns to R&D.

* [Bayesian Distribution Regression](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048658) (with Weige Huang, status: working paper)
  + R Package: [bayesdistreg](https://estsyawo.github.io/bayesdistreg/index.html)

  **Abstract**: This paper introduces a Bayesian version of distribution regression that enables inference on estimated distributions, quantiles, distributional effects, among other functionals of interest. Our estimators come in three categories: the non-asymptotic, semi-asymptotic, and asymptotic. To conduct simultaneous inference on a function of any estimator, we introduce asymmetric and symmetric Bayesian confidence bands. Inference on point estimates is conducted via posterior intervals. The Bayesian asymptotic theory we develop extends the foregoing to gains in computational time and tractability of posterior distributions. Monte Carlo simulations conducted illustrate good performance of our estimators. We apply our estimators to evaluate the impact of institutional ownership on firm innovation.
