	\item  \href{https://estsyawo.github.io/Tsyawo_JMP.pdf#}{R\&D spillover effects on firm innovation - Estimating the spatial matrix from panel data}, (Job Market Paper)
	
	\textbf{Abstract}: Firms' research and development (R\&D) efforts are known to have spillover effects on other firms' outcomes, e.g., innovation. Quantifying R\&D spillover effects requires a spatial matrix
	that characterises the interaction structure between firms. Estimates can be biased if the
	spatial matrix is misspecified. This paper proposes a parsimonious approach to estimating
	the spatial matrix and parameters from panel data, when the spatial matrix is partly or fully
	unknown. The approach is robust to misspecification of the spatial matrix, and it is applicable
	to single index models. It allows asymmetry and time-variation in the spatial matrix. The paper
	establishes consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE under conditional independence
	and conditional strong-mixing assumptions on the outcome variable. On firm innovation, I
	find positive spillover and private effects of R\&D. I provide evidence of time-variation and
	asymmetry in the interaction structure between firms and find that geographic proximity and
	product market proximity are relevant. Moreover, connectivity between firms is not limited to
	often-assumed notions of closeness; it is also linked to past R\&D and patenting behaviour of
	firms.
	
	\item \href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3394012}{Clustered Covariate Regression}, (with Abdul-Nasah Soale) - \textit{Presented at the Mid-West Econometrics Group Conference, October 2019}
	
%	\textbf{Abstract}: This paper introduces an estimator for a general class of models under rank deficiency arising from high dimensionality, multicollinearity, or both. Our approach obtains a projection matrix that projects a high-dimensional (potentially growing $ p >> n $) parameter vector into a reduced consistently estimable one. We show consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Recovering the high-dimensional parameter vector using the projection matrix leaves precision unaffected. We employ a sequential estimation algorithm that, at once, obtains parameter estimates and the projection matrix. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate a high approximative ability of high-dimensional parameters, improved precision, and reduced bias even under multicollinearity. In our empirical application, we find that firms on average generate positive R\&D spillovers on firm productivity though these are dominated by private returns to R\&D.
	
	
	\item \href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048658}{Bayesian Distribution Regression}, (with Weige Huang)
	
%	\textbf{Abstract}: This paper introduces a Bayesian version of distribution regression that enables inference on estimated distributions, quantiles, distributional effects, among other functionals of interest. Our estimators come in three categories: the non-asymptotic, semi-asymptotic, and asymptotic. To conduct simultaneous inference on a function of any estimator, we introduce asymmetric and symmetric Bayesian confidence bands. Inference on point estimates is conducted via posterior intervals. The Bayesian asymptotic theory we develop extends the foregoing to gains in computational time and tractability of posterior distributions. Monte Carlo simulations conducted illustrate good performance of our estimators. We apply our estimators to evaluate the impact of institutional ownership on firm innovation. 
	
%	\item \href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3194286}{Recovering distributions for the estimation of treatment
%		effects under partly unobserved treatment with repeated
%		cross-sections}
	
%	\textbf{Abstract}: This paper develops an approach to estimating quantile treatment effects among other distribution-based measures of treatment effects when treatment status is unobserved in some periods by using a maximum likelihood-based finite mixture approach that combines the multinoulli and the asymmetric Laplace distributions (ALD). We show that by treating the unobserved treatment status as latent and using the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to recover unobserved treatment statuses and distributions, employing quantile differences-indifferences (QDID), changes-in-changes (CIC) among other estimators of treatment effects is straightforward. To evaluate the small sample performance of our model, we employ Monte Carlo simulations and find that the model generally outperforms naive ones that substitute available proxies for unobserved treatment.
